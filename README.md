# AOC2021-ocaml

My attempt of solving [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) with Ocaml. I am a total beginner with ocaml, so this is a learning experience. I don't trust myself to finish this, I might switch to python or C++ along the way.

## Devcontainer

This repo also contains a .devcontainer folder for vs-code which provides an environment for writing and running ocaml code.
